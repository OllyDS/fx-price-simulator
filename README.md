# FX Price History Simulator - WIP
The following binary can be used to create dummy historical data for various FX crosses.
I created this to practice my rust and to generate constantly changing prices for an FX Trading game I am working on. 

## Arguments
The binary requires you to pass 2 arguments.

1) A Currency Pair from the below list:
   1) GBP/USD
   2) EUR/USD
   3) EUR/GBP
2) The number of prices you wish to generate. E.G. 100.
